Application to run GLSL fragment shaders

## What is FragRoom?
It is a small application that allows you to execute GLSL fragment shaders. These shaders are small programs that run once for every pixel. With them you can make stunning visuals and art.

## Usage
You open the files containing the raw GLSL code. They can also have additional options(Discussed later)
You can directly open the files (**.fgrom** or **.glsl**) with the app, or directly execute the program and it will try to execute one of the following: *fragment.fgrom*, *fragment.glsl*.
If the application can't find the specified file or any of the following, it will display a warning and a green/blue interrogation mark.
If the compiling process of the shader fails, it will display a warning detailing the error(so you have a hint on what to solve ;) ), and it will display a yellow/red warning symbol.

I modified an existing GLSL notepad++ language to make it useful for this application. I do not take any credits because i did not do the majority of the work. I unfortunately dont remember where i found it. You can download it [here](./n++)

## Code-wise specifications
The input of the shader is a vec2 called **fragCoord**. It has the coordinates of the pixel, ranging from \[-1, -1\](Left bottom corner) to \[1, 1\](Right top corner).
The output is a vec4, which can be called **fragColor** or any other thing you would like. It must have the format (R, G, B, Alpha).

### Uniforms
There are multiple uniforms provided.
|Name|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|iTime|float|Time since the application started, in seconds|
|iFrame|int|The number of processed frames|
|iResolution|vec2|Resolution of the window, in pixels|
|iHour|vec3|Hour of the system. Format: (Hour, Minute, Second)|
|iDate|vec3|Date of the system. Format: (Day, Month, Year)|
|iFps|float|Fps at which the app is running|
|iMouse|vec2|Coordinates of the mouse pointer. Same format as fragCoord|
|iTexture|sampler2D\[8\]|Textures, loaded from files. Has to be used paired with the texture options|
|iBackBuffer|sampler2D|Last frame, as a texture. Important to note, it will be erased when the window changes size|

There are examples of their use in [here](./examples).

### Options
This application provides with aditional options, also contained in the code file. They are passed in the form *@option : value*.
The application will read these lines at the start if the file only, and will stop when encountering a blank line.
These are all the options:
|Option|Values|Description|
|---:|:---|---|
|title|any string|The title of the window. It can include special sequences, discussed later|
|width|non-negative number|The starting width of the window|
|height|non-negative number|The starting height of the window|
|allowClose|0 or 1|If it allows the window to be closed with a key. Default will allow|
|closeKey|number representing a key|The key that will close the app. Can also type *esc* and it will be the escape key. Default is the escape key|
|secsToAutoClose|non-negative number|How many seconds the app will wait before closing. Default is it won't close|
|fullscreen|0 or 1|If the application starts fullscreened. Default is not|
|allowToggleFullscreen|0 or 1|If you will be able to toggle fullscreen on and off. Default is allowed|
|fullscreenKey|number representing a key|The key that will toggle fullscreen. Can also type *f11* and it will be F11 key. Default is F11 key|
|vsync|0 or 1|If the application uses VSync. Default is not|
|grabCursor|0 or 1|If the cursor will be grabbed by the application or not. Default is not|
|maxFps|non-negative number|The maximum fps. Default is 144|
|icon|file path|The path to the **.png** (other files extensions may work) file that will be used as icon. Default is the normal app icon|
|texture*X*L (X can be between 0 and 7)|file path|The path to the **.png** (other files extensions may work) file that will be loaded as the texture X, with linear filters (iTexture\[X\])|
|texture*X*N (X can be between 0 and 7)|file path|The path to the **.png** (other files extensions may work) file that will be loaded as the texture X, with nearest filters (iTexture\[X\])|

You can find examples [here](./examples/options).

These are the special sequences for the title:
|Option|Value|
|---:|:---|
|%p|The full path of the shader file|
|%f|Name of the shader file, with extension|
|%n|Name of the shader file, without extension|
|%d|Current date|

You can find examples [here](./examples/title).

## CLI features
There is a good CLI help menu available if you do `fragroom -h`.

### Translate feature
When coding cool shaders, you often work in multiple places, each one with different formats and names for the names of the same things. With FragRoom, you can easily translate between those formats!  
There is support for translating from and to [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/), [Shader Editor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.markusfisch.android.shadereditor&pcampaignid=web_share), and WebGL compatible code.  
To translate, you have to use the CLI as:

`fragroom translate <inputFormat> <outputFormat> <filePath>`

A *glsl* or *fgrom* file will be generated.

The list of valid formats is:
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|shadertoy|The popular web page [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com) |
|shadereditor|The android app [Shader Editor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.markusfisch.android.shadereditor&pcampaignid=web_share) |
|webgl|WebGL 2.0 compatible code|
|fragroom|The format used by this very application|

Conversion between some formats might not be supported.

When translating from Shadertoy, you can specify the id of the shader (http://www.shadertoy.com/view/XXXXXX) instead of having to download it.

For example, the code of [this Shadertoy shader](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/lXyfzD) was translated using FragRoom.
There are some examples [here](./examples/translations).

### Web feature
You can transform FragRoom files into *html* files that contain everything needed for the shader to be executed in the browser, using WebGL2. It contains the textures, the shader code, and everything else needed.  
To transform it, you have to use the CLI as:

`fragroom web <filePath>`

An *html* file will be generated.

There are some examples [here](./examples/web).

## Tebas template
There is a [Tebas project manager](https://github.com/siljamdev/Tebas) template available to more easily develop fragroom shaders. It is available to download [here](https://github.com/siljamdev/Tebas/blob/main/templates/Fragroom/fgrom.tbtem)
